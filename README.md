### The Cooper Challenge

This is the API of the first full stack application that we have created!
We have used Ruby on Rails 6.0.2.1 to create a backend API and used React 16.12.0 for the frontend and user interface. 

The application is a calculation of the Cooper test where the user can sign up, log in and then fill in the distance they ran in 12 minutes, gender and age. In the return the user gets a Cooper index. 
The user can show their previous results and will then get a line diagram with all their previous data.
